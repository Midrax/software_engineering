# Software Engineering

This repository contains notes from "Software Engineering", a module from my BSc in Computer Science at Sapienza University, in Rome. Although the assessment brief and the module coursework are in italian, they've been uploaded in order to showcase the organizational and project planning skills acquired while attending the course.
